* Concept

- build a HD/VSA framework for wolfram + wolframite

- Inspirations:
  - https://torchhd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
  - https://www.hd-computing.com/software

- Re-cook HD/VSA papers;
  - https://github.com/IBM/neuro-vector-symbolic-architectures-raven
  - (integrate with existing neural net framework of wolfram)

- Apply the approach and investige architectures / parameters etc. to
  - arc-AGI (filter a 3x3 dataset?)
  - copycat domain

- Attempt to model 'analogical reasoning' (see existing Lit)


** Mushroom body models?

- make a HD version of mushrooom body models,
  compare to sparse distrubute memory, modern hopfield and transformer architectures

- try those also as analogical reasoners


* Implementations

- HD/VSA: MAP, block sparse, ...
- resonator networks
- Sparse Distrubuted Memory
